# JS-Calculator
Calculator made in JavaScript  
  
05/09/2022 - Created the basic layout.  
  
11/09/2022 - Project complete and it is now a functioning basic calculator.  
  
The actual design is inspired by an iPhone calculator. I have referred to tutorials for the Javascript as this is part of my project based learning. Whilst I did refer to a tutorial I made sure I understood what I was doing before moving on.  
  
Got more exposure to the Javascript keyword This. Also had more exposure to the Switch statement. Bits of troubleshooting as well as I got it wrong couple of times.
